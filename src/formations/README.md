# Formations :books:

Graduated in 2020 as a computer engineer from Telecom St Etienne. During my studies I founded the startup Jobseeker (owner of the [Innkeeper.fr](https://innkeeper.fr/) platform) where I was CTO for 3 years. Following this experience I work as a freelance developer in various technologies and frameworks.

Recently, I've been focusing on blockchain technologies where I'm working as an open-source developer for [Laguna Finance](https://www.laguna.finance/)
